This is an example of making an API call recursively until there are no more pages to retrieve.

### Development

Ensure you have node installed (I recommend using homebrew on OSX), then use npm to install JavaScript dependencies:

    npm install

Run the application:

    node main.js

Or:

    node main_es6.js

You can edit the API url as desired in main.js or main_es6.js.
